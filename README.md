# **YouTube Copy Clean URL**  

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
A Firefox and Chrome extension designed to simplify sharing clean YouTube links.  
**Note:** This extension is currently only available for **PC**.

## Why This Extension Was Created

This extension was created out of frustration with YouTube injecting unnecessary parameters like `?si=` and `&pp=` into copied links, even when using the CleanURL extension. To solve this issue, I decided to build my own extension (with some assistance from ChatGPT for the initial code, as I wasn’t familiar with extension development).
=======
A **Firefox** and **Chrome** extension that removes unnecessary tracking parameters from YouTube links.  
🔹 **Note:** This extension is only available for **PC** (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## **🛠️ Why Was This Extension Created?**  
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

YouTube often adds unwanted tracking parameters like `?si=` and `&pp=` to copied links, even when using tools like CleanURL.  
Frustrated by this, I created my own extension to ensure clean, shareable YouTube URLs.  

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
This extension removes all unnecessary tracking parameters such as `?si=` and `&pp=` from YouTube links while preserving important parameters like:
- `?v=` for the video ID
- `&t=` for the timestamp
- `&list=` for the playlist ID
- `&index=` for the playlist index
