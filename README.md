# YouTube Copy Clean URL

A Firefox and Chrome extension designed to simplify sharing clean YouTube links.  
**Note:** This extension is currently only available for **PC**.

## Why This Extension Was Created

This extension was created out of frustration with YouTube injecting unnecessary parameters like `?si=` and `&pp=` into copied links, even when using the CleanURL extension. To solve this issue, I decided to build my own extension (with some assistance from ChatGPT for the initial code, as I wasnâ€™t familiar with extension development).

## What This Extension Does

This extension removes all unnecessary tracking parameters such as `?si=` and `&pp=` from YouTube links while preserving important parameters like:
- `?v=` for the video ID
- `&t=` for the timestamp
- `&list=` for the playlist ID
- `&index=` for the playlist index

## New Settings Menu

- Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the settings menu.
- Use the toggles to enable or disable options for:
  - **Timestamp**
  - **Playlist**
  - **Shorten Link**
  
   - Enabling the **Playlist** setting will also disable the `&index=` parameter in the URL.  
- Settings should sync across devices, but this feature is not fully guaranteed.
